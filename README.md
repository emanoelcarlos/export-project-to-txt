# Project export-project-to-txt

This project scans a project structure and converts all your files to .txt format.
Exported files keep the same original project structure.

## How to use

First, you need to install Node.js. Once Node.js is installed:
- open a terminal
- through the terminal enter into the export-project-to-txt project folder
- run the command: `node index.js <path-of-the-original-project> <path-from-which-the-project-will-be-exported>`
- `ENTER`

Done, in the destination directory there will be a copy of all the original directories containing only files with the original content, but in .txt format.
